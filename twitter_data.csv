/End soapboax"
9662,"the reality is Amazon will have added maybe $15b+ of incremental dollars this holiday season bc 3P is growing faster than 1P, much faster, last Q 3P grew 18.67% YOY while 1P grew 3% YOY. This is actually the best scenario imaginable for $AMZN ."

1P - $60b
3P - $33B
AWS - $17.5B
Subs - $8.5B
Other - $11.5B
Physical - $4.6B

Which puts us right in the middle of Amazon's $130-140b guide. The media will panic and say amazon is slowing, CNBC &amp; every outlet will be mentioning the re-open but"
9664,"In a sane world, Amazon would report its 3P GMV just like they report total sales of other segments, not their cut. I've speculated they do this in an attempt to keep regulators from knowing the true size of Amazon but for whatever reason they do it, and it makes growth hard now"

9667,"So how is this relevant &amp; why do I think we still miss even with record sales from 3p? Simply bc Amazon is likely imo going to have a decelerating 1P number it was $66.45B last Q4, thats a tough one to beat on the mediocre 1P stuff, but here's why you shouldn't care....."
9668,"Now why is this so important $AMZN posts this note? Q4 2020 was their biggest 3P ever coming into this year, $27.33B. Amazon says this Holiday Q was bigger,more 3P sales means more 3P fees, more ads, &amp; knowing what we know(from my pinned thread), 3P fees are their biggest segment"
